## How to run
For GUI implementation used PySide6, all required packages in requirements.txt. App  tested on Python 3.11.
To run the app you should run main.py, login data also in main.py.
Or you can run tests/test_multiplayer.py to create three bots in different threads.

## Module description
**main.py** entry point with login data

**connection.py** contains Connection class that provides client-server interact

### logic folder
**game.py** contains Game thread class with main game loop.

**model.py** contains classes to parse and store game data:
- GameMap - parse and store static game map objects
- GameState - parse and store dynamic game data
- GameActions - parse and store actions provided in previous turn / currently not used

### GUI folder
**ui.py** constants used in GUI

**main_window.py** contains main window of the app 

**hex_widget.py** contains Hex QWidget class, used by main window to represent game cells in GUI

### tests folder
**test_cell.py** unittest for cell.py

**test_connection.py** unittest for connection.py

**test_multiplayer.py** alternative entry point to the app that runs three bots in different threads to test multiplayer
